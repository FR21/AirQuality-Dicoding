# Air Quality Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores air quality trends across multiple cities using Python. It covers data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualization. Additionally, an interactive dashboard is built using Streamlit to provide insights into air pollution patterns.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Data wrangling & preprocessing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Statistical insights on air pollution trends
✅ Interactive visualization with Streamlit

## 🛠️ Setup Environment
You can set up the environment using Anaconda or a standard Shell/Terminal method.
🔹 Using Anaconda
```sh
conda create --name main-ds python=3.12
conda activate main-ds
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
🔹 Using Shell/Terminal
```sh
mkdir proyek_analisis_data
cd proyek_analisis_data
pipenv install
pipenv shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Running the Streamlit Dashboard
To launch the interactive dashboard, run the following command:
```sh
streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py
```

##💡 Key Insights
- Analyzed air quality trends (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3) across cities.
- Examined the impact of temperature, humidity, and rainfall on pollution.
- Identified cities with the highest pollution levels and seasonal variations.
